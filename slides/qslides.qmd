## Persuasion is an alternative to mandates 
- Pro-vaccine scientific consensus built on clinical trials and more showing 
  - Vaccines are effective
  - Vaccines are [innocuous]{.alert}

- Communicating that information is potentially welfare improving 


::: {.fragment}
- Communication reduces vaccine hesitance only when
  1. Beliefs inconsistent with scientific evidence
  2. Choices are sensitive to beliefs
  3. Vaccine hesitant find evidence credible and relevant
::: 

## We experimentally provide information on flu vaccine [side effects]{.alert} 
- Promising context : 
  - Falling vaccination rates, matters for health 
  - Excess pessimism about side effects
  - Side effects matter for chocies 

- Uncertain whether information from trials affects personal beliefs
  - Vaccine skepticism strongly associated with mistrust of institutions
  - Trial population may not be personally relevant  




## Research questions and hypotheses
  1. Does information shift beliefs?
    - Hypothesis: Yes, especially for people with more biased beliefs

  2. Does information [source]{.alert} and [relevance]{.alert} matter?
    - Hypothesis: Academic sources and similar trial populations matter most

  3. Does information shift vaccine intentions and behaviors? 
    - Hypothesis: Yes




## Background

# Design

## Experiment overview
- goal
- waves 
- interventions

## screening wave
- measure vaccine intentent
- ask about trust in gov, docs, info sources
- prior vaccination experience (ever taken, side effect)

## Main wave 
- consent
- priors
- info provision
- posteriors
  - trial
  - self 
- vaccine intentions (re-ask), plus link-to-click
- views about info provisios
  - trial trustworthy?
  - trial relevant? 

## Info provision intervention

- slick slide unfolding with different treatments + rationales

## Key measures

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Outcomes

- $\Delta_{self}$ Side effect delta (pre-specified primary)
- Side effect experienced in treatment arm of clinical trial
- Intend to vaccinate
- Clicked on a link
- Indicated vaccination in follow-up survey
:::

::: {.column width="50%" .fragment}
Controls (pre-specified, power-improving)

- Covariate 1
- Covariate 2

## Heterogeneous effects point to real learning rather than experimenter demand
- Effects are larger when learning is more plausible
  - ... because priors are higher (direct measure or via prior experience)
  - ... because people trust trial more  (despite [lower]{.alert} control mean)
  - ... because people find trial more  relevant (despite [lower]{.alert} control mean)

- Suggests experimenter demand does not drive belief effects
  - Experimenter demand likely implies low level for $\Delta_{self}$
  - Hard to see how it could generate [heterogeneous]{.alert} effects
