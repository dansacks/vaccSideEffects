## Do falling vaccination rates call for mandates?

View 1: Right to refuse treatment outweights health consequences

- No mandate

View 2: Health consequences are large, positive, and rooted in science

- Mandate?

[Hypothesis: Communicating science of vaccines should persuade people to vaccinate]{.fragment}

[This paper: experimental on communicating clinical trial results for flu vacc]{.fragment}

## Testing persuasive communication is valuable 
Communicating safety and efficacy of trials is potentially welfare improving 

- Addresses [internality]{.alert}, not externality 

Communication reduces vaccine hesitancy only under certain conditions

::: {.incremental}

1. Beliefs inconsistent with scientific evidence + matters for choice; internality present
2. Vaccine hesitant find evidence credible and relevant $\leftarrow$ Far from obviously true! 

::: 

::: {.fragment}
If communication fails, either

- It is not persuasive; does not move [beliefs]{.alert}
- There is a hole in the scientific record; we aren't measuring some salient cost or benefit

::: 

## An experiment in flu vaccine side effect information 

Why flu vaccine side effects? 

- low and falling flu vaccination rates, important for health
- Excess pessimism about side effects, side effects matter
- Unclear whether information from trials affects beliefs

Research questions:

::: {.incremental}

1. Can side effect information from scientific studies shift beliefs about [personal risk]{.alert}?
2. Do responses vary with [source]{.alert} and [study population]{.alert}?
3. Does information shift vaccine [intention]{.alert} and [take-up]{.alert}?

:::

## Study overview

Recruit of 3500 flu vaccine hesitant Amercians on prolific, to Qualtrics survey experiment

Explain clinical trials and report placebo group side effect rate in clinicial trial. Randomize

1. Control: No info about vaccine group side effect rate
2. Industry: Info about vaccine group side effect rate in [manufacturer clinical trial]{.alert}
3. Academic: Info about vaccine group side effect rate in [academic study]{.alert}
4. Personal: As academic, but explain participants are [vaccine hesitant prolific users]{.alert}

[The information provision is extremely uncreative and unslick.]{.fragment}

:::{.fragment}
Elicit beliefs about personal side effect risk and vaccine intentions, actual vaccination

- Personal risk belief is pre-specified primary outcome 

:::

## Preliminary study results 

Side effect information from scientific studies shifts [beliefs about personal risk]{.alert}

  - by 3 percentage points on a base of 15 (vs. 0-1 in clinical trials)

Belief responses don't clearly move with [source]{.alert} and [study population]{.alert}?

  - Industry and academic arms similar have similar treatment effects; personal arm null

Information shifts vaccine intentions, noisy effect on actual vaccination

  - Academic and personal arms only  

:::{.fragment}
Results are highly heterogeneous by political views [(not preregistered)]{.alert}

  - Liberals' beliefs and vaccine intententions respond strongly, conservatives null/negative
  - Politics predict whether people find trials + uni reserach trustworthy + relevant
::: 

## What is new here?
Literature on vaccine hesitancy and beliefs

- Vaccine hesitancy highly correalted with trust in institutions
- Unhelpful to correct false beliefs (flu, pediatric)
- Flu vaccine hesitancy correlated with pessimistic side effect beliefs
- Identity of messenger can matter (racial concordance, political concordance)
- [Contribution:]{.alert} Message content matters: side effect infomation moves beliefs
- [Contribution:]{.alert} Mistrust in institutions matters because it impedes learning 

Literature on information provision experiments 

- Simple information provisions shift beliefs and behaviors 
- [Contribution]{.alert}: Simple information provision with skeptical audience more challenging

# Experiment Design

## Experiment overivew

[Screening wave]{.alert} Recruit 8,000, screen for vaccine hesitancy, late November

- Don't intend to vaccinate against flu; may or may not vaccinate against flu
- Also measure vaccine information sources and experience with flu and COVID vaccines

[Main wave]{.alert} 3,500 vaccine hesitant participants, 1-7 days later

- Randomize information provision, measure priors, posteriors, vaccine intentions 
- Ask about trustworthiness and relevance of information, politics, demographics

[Follow-up wave]{.alert} 3,000 participants, 2-4 weeks later

- Obfuscate intentions then measure whether vaccinated this season
- Also measure recall of wave 2 (not discussed today)

## Eliciting side effect beliefs 
### Conceptualization 

"Side effect" is causal effect of vaccine on severe adverse event rate

"Severe" corresponds to grade 3, disruptive to your day - real cost, not just notiecable 

Two requirements for us

1. Person specific: participant's expected effect, not population or trial average effect
2. Causal contrast, not level of symptom: $\Delta_{self,i} = y_i(1)-y_i(0)$


## Eliciting side effect beliefs 
### Operationalizaiton  

We get causal contrast by eliciting both potential outcomes. To elicit $\tilde{y}_{i}(0)$:

> For this question, please imagine, regardless of your actual vaccination status, that you **DO NOT** get the flu vaccine tomorrow or in the following few days.
>
> Thinking about yourself, how likely do you think you would be to experience a severe adverse event, such as headache, muscle ache, tiredness, joint pain, fever, chills, or general discomfort, in the following few days? 
>*(As a reminder, severe means bad enough to disrupty your daily activity)*

Elicit $\tilde{y}_i(1)$ analogously.  Subjective side effect rate $\Delta_{self,i} = y_{i}(1)-y_{i}(0)$.

:::{.fragment}
Before information provision, elicit [priors]{.alert} for $y_i(0)$ and $y_i(1)$ using [likert scale]{.alert}

## Politics matter  because they correlate with determinants of belief updating
### Caution: not pre-specified

View of trial

- Did you find it trustworthy? (0-10 scale)
- Did ou find relevant? (0-10 scale)

Views of university-provided information

- Do you obtain health care info from university research or researchers? 
- Do you consider it it reliable?


## Politics matter  because they correlate with determinants of belief updating

## Expressive responding and experimenter demand are unlikely to explain these results {#expressive-slide}

Expressive responding: people are using the survey to express their vaccine preferences

Experimenter demand: participants tell us what they think we want to hear

Very difficult to explain pattern of treatment effects thusly

- Participants don't know which treatment arm they're in
- Control-vs-industry: no differential signal of experiment intent, but shows treatment effect
- Little priming: Political views after beliefs

More evidence: reported $\Delta_{self}$ inconsistent with expressive answering [Appendix →](#appendix-toc-slide){.button}

- Correlated with believed trial SE rate, own flu + covid vaccine experiencs 
- Correlations similar by political view


# Conclusions

## Conclusions and future work

An extremely uncreative, unslick presentation of scientific information made vaccine hesitant people update their [beliefs]{.alert} in a pro-vaccine direction 

When belief updating happens, scientific information shifts [intentions]{.alert}

- Political views key moderator of belief updating, via perceived study informativeness

Effect on [vaccinations]{.alert} statistically imprecise; noisy null

::: {.fragment}
Getting detectable effect on vaccinations likely requires bigger belief updating 

- Better presentation and communication of trials?
- Bigger information intervention (effectiveness + side effects)?
- Trusted, relevant source?
- Possibly other dimensions of information are more important?
