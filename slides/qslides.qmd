If vaccinations are so effective, and the science is so clear,
why do we need mandates?

Shouldn't information about clinical trials be enough to persuade people to vaccinate?

[We ran an experiment to find out]{.fragment}
:::

## Testing persuasive communication is valuable 
Communicating safety and efficacy of trials is potentially welfare improving 

- Addresses [internality]{.alert}, not externality 

Communication reduces vaccine hesitancy only under certain conditions

::: {.incremental}

1. Beliefs inconsistent with scientific evidence; internality present
2. Vaccine hesitant find evidence credible and relevant $\leftarrow$ Far from obviously true! 

::: 

::: {.fragment}
If communication fails, either

- It is not persuasive; does not move [beliefs]{.alert}
- There is a hole in the scientific record; we aren't measuring some salient cost or benefit

## An experiment in flu vaccine side effect information 

Why flu vaccine side effects? 

- low and falling flu vaccination rates, important for health
- Excess pessimism about side effects, side effects matter
- Unclear whether information from trials affects beliefs

Research questions:

::: {.incremental}

1. Can side effect information from scientific studies shift beliefs about [personal risk]{.alert}?
2. Do responses vary with [source]{.alert} and [study population]{.alert}?
3. Does information shift vaccine [intention]{.alert} and [take-up]{.alert}?

:::

## Study overview

Recruit of 3500 flu vaccine hesitant Amercians on prolific, to Qualtrics survey experiment

Explain clinical trials and report placebo group side effect rate in clinicial trial. Randomize

1. Control: No info about vaccine group side effect rate
2. Industry: Info about vaccine group side effect rate in [manufacturer clinical trial]{.alert}
3. Academic: Info about vaccine group side effect rate in [academic study]{.alert}
4. Personal: As academic, but explain participants are [vaccine hesitant prolific users]{.alert}

[The information provision is extremely uncreative and unslick.]{.fragment}

:::{.fragment}
Elicit beliefs about personal side effect risk and vaccine intentions, actual vaccination

- Personal risk belief is pre-specified primary outcome 

:::

## Preliminary study results 

1. Can side effect information from scientific studies shift [beliefs about personal risk]{.alert}?
  - Yes, by 3 percentage points on a base of 15
  - Implied learning rate of 20\% smaller effect here than in other contexts 

:::{.fragment}

2. Do belief responses vary with [source]{.alert} and [study population]{.alert}?
  - Yes, in surprising way: industry and academic arms similar; personal arm null
:::

:::{.fragment}
3. Does information shift vaccine [intention]{.alert} and [take-up]{.alert}?

  - Yes, in surprising way: academic and personal moved intentions a lot; industry did not
  - Effects on take-up are positive but noisy
:::

## What is new here?
Literature on vaccine hesitancy and beliefs

- One strand finds it is not helpful to correct false beliefs 
- Another shows vaccine hesitancy correlated with pessimistic side effect beliefs
- Contribution: Side effect infomation can move side effect beliefs 

Literature on information provision experiments 

- Simple information provisions shift beliefs and behaviors 
- Contribution: Simple information provision can move beliefs even with skeptical audience 

# Experiment Design

## Experiment overivew

[Screening wave]{.alert} Recruit 8,000, screen for vaccine hesitancy, late November

- Don't intend to vaccinate against flu; may or may not vaccinate against flu
- Also measure vaccine information sources and experience with flu and COVID vaccines

[Main wave]{.alert} 3,500 vaccine hesitant participants, 1-7 days later

- Randomize information provision, measure priors, posteriors, vaccine intentions 
- Ask about trustworthiness and relevance of information

[Follow-up wave]{.alert} 3,000 participants, 2-4 weeks later

- Obfuscate intentions then measure whether vaccinated this season
- Also measure recall of wave 2 (not discussed today)

## Eliciting side effect beliefs 
### Conceptualization 

"Side effect" is causal effect of vaccine on severe adverse event rate

"Severe" corresponds to grade 3, disruptive to your day - real cost, not just notiecable 

Two requirements for us

1. Person specific: participant's expected effect, not population or trial average effect
2. Causal contrast, not level of symptom: $\Delta_{self,i} = y_i(1)-y_i(0)$


## Eliciting side effect beliefs 
### Operationalizaiton  

We get causal contrast by eliciting both potential outcomes. To elicit $\tilde{y}_{i}(0)$:

> For this question, please imagine, regardless of your actual vaccination status, that you **DO NOT** get the flu vaccine tomorrow or in the following few days.
>
> Thinking about yourself, how likely do you think you would be to experience a severe adverse event, such as headache, muscle ache, tiredness, joint pain, fever, chills, or general discomfort, in the following few days? 
>*(As a reminder, severe means bad enough to disrupty your daily activity)*

Elicit $\tilde{y}_i(1)$ analogously.  Subjective side effect rate $\Delta_{self,i} = y_{i}(1)-y_{i}(0)$.

Before information provision, elicit priors for $y_i(0)$ and $y_i(1)$ using [likert scale]{.alert}

## Heterogeneous effects point to real learning rather than experimenter demand
- Effects are larger when learning is more plausible
  - ... because priors are higher (direct measure or via prior experience)
  - ... because people trust trial more  (despite [lower]{.alert} control mean)
  - ... because people find trial more  relevant (despite [lower]{.alert} control mean)

- Suggests experimenter demand does not drive belief effects
  - Experimenter demand likely implies low level for $\Delta_{self}$
  - Hard to see how it could generate [heterogeneous]{.alert} effects

## Persistence of Learning

## Take-aways and open questions

An extremely uncreative, unslick presentation of scientific information made vaccine hesitant people somewhat more optimistic about vaccines

Some evidence that the information shifted intentions

Moving vaccinations likely requires bigger belief updating 

- Possibly a bigger information intervention would be more effective
- Possibly some people are too skeptical of industry+academia to shift their beliefs
- Possibly other dimensions of information are more important
