## Can we persuade people to vaccinate?

- historically, coercive approaches: school and work mandates
  - "coercive" meaning individuals weakly worse off under rational choice
  - Current administration does not support
- Persuasive approaches: subsidies, **information provision**
  - Subsidies are expensive
  - Information is promising

# Background

## Background

# Design

## Experiment overview
- goal
- waves 
- interventions

## screening wave
- measure vaccine intentent
- ask about trust in gov, docs, info sources
- prior vaccination experience (ever taken, side effect)

## Main wave 
- consent
- priors
- info provision
- posteriors
  - trial
  - self 
- vaccine intentions (re-ask), plus link-to-click
- views about info provisions 

## Info provision intervention

- slick slide unfolding with different treatments + rationales

Outcomes

- Primary: side effect delta
- Side effect experienced in treatment arm of clinical trial
- Intend to vaccinate
- Clicked on a link
- Indicated vaccination in follow-up survey
