If vaccinations are so effective, and the science is so clear,
why do we need mandates?

Shouldn't information about clinical trials be enough to persuade people to vaccinate?

[We ran an experiment to find out]{.fragment}
:::

## Persuasion is an alternative to mandates 
Pro-vaccine scientific consensus built on clinical trials and more showing 

- Vaccines are effective
- Vaccines are [innocuous]{.alert}

Communicating that information is potentially welfare improving 


::: {.fragment}
Communication reduces vaccine hesitance only when

1. Beliefs inconsistent with scientific evidence
2. Choices are sensitive to beliefs
3. Vaccine hesitant find evidence credible and relevant
::: 

::: {.fragment}
Our experiment: provide trial info on flu vaccine [side effects]{.alert} 

- low and falling flu vaccination rates, important for health
- Excess pessimism about side effects, side effects matter
- Unclear whether informoation from trials affects beliefs
:::





## Research questions and hypotheses

1. Does information from clinical trials about side effects shift personal beliefs?
   [H1: As vaccine hesitant people's beliefs are generally more pessimistic than warranted by tials, this information will reduce expected side effects, especially for people with more biased beliefs]{.hyp}

2. Does information [source]{.alert} and [relevance]{.alert} matter?
   [H2.A: As vaccine hesitant people are often skeptical about institutions and pharmacy companies, beliefs will respond more to [academic]{.alert} than [industry]{.alert} trials]{.hyp}

   [H2.B: As vaccine hesitant people believe they experience worse-than-average side effects, beliefs will respond more to trials with [relevant population]{.alert} trials]{.hyp}

3. Does information shift vaccine intentions and behaviors?
   [H3: As side effects are relevant for vaccinations, info will increase vaccinations]{.hyp}
   
   [We are underpowerd for this outcome and pre-registered it as secondary]{.hyp}




## Background

# Design

## Experiment overview
- goal
- waves 
- interventions

## screening wave
- measure vaccine intentent
- ask about trust in gov, docs, info sources
- prior vaccination experience (ever taken, side effect)

## Main wave 
- consent
- priors
- info provision
- posteriors
  - trial
  - self 
- vaccine intentions (re-ask), plus link-to-click
- views about info provisios
  - trial trustworthy?
  - trial relevant? 

## Info provision intervention

- slick slide unfolding with different treatments + rationales

## Key measures

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Outcomes

- $\Delta_{self}$ Side effect delta (pre-specified primary)
- Side effect experienced in treatment arm of clinical trial
- Intend to vaccinate
- Clicked on a link
- Indicated vaccination in follow-up survey

::: {.column width="50%" .fragment}
Controls (pre-specified, power-improving)

- Covariate 1
- Covariate 2

## Heterogeneous effects point to real learning rather than experimenter demand
- Effects are larger when learning is more plausible
  - ... because priors are higher (direct measure or via prior experience)
  - ... because people trust trial more  (despite [lower]{.alert} control mean)
  - ... because people find trial more  relevant (despite [lower]{.alert} control mean)

- Suggests experimenter demand does not drive belief effects
  - Experimenter demand likely implies low level for $\Delta_{self}$
  - Hard to see how it could generate [heterogeneous]{.alert} effects
