## Can we persuade people to vaccinate?

- Vaccination rates are falling 
- Limited appetite for mandates
- Persuasion is promising
  - Vaccines are effective
  - Vaccines are [innocuous]{.alert}
- MOTIVATE

(1) SIDE EFFECT INFO
(2) BELIEF AS OUTCOME
(3) SPECIFIC PROVISION

assertion: little effort to convince people by showing them quality of scientific evidence, rather than making arguments from authority [cite nyt article; background]

# Background

## Background

# Design

## Experiment overview
- goal
- waves 
- interventions

## screening wave
- measure vaccine intentent
- ask about trust in gov, docs, info sources
- prior vaccination experience (ever taken, side effect)

## Main wave 
- consent
- priors
- info provision
- posteriors
  - trial
  - self 
- vaccine intentions (re-ask), plus link-to-click
- views about info provisios
  - trial trustworthy?
  - trial relevant? 

## Info provision intervention

- slick slide unfolding with different treatments + rationales

## Key measures

::: {.column width="50%"}
Outcomes

- $\Delta_{self}$ Side effect delta (pre-specified primary)
- Side effect experienced in treatment arm of clinical trial
- Intend to vaccinate
- Clicked on a link
- Indicated vaccination in follow-up survey

::: {.column width="50%" .fragment}
Controls (pre-specified, power-improving)

- Covariate 1

## Heterogeneous effects point to real learning rather than experimenter demand
- Effects are larger when learning is more plausible
  - ... because priors are higher (direct measure or via prior experience)
  - ... because people trust trial more  (despite [lower]{.alert} control mean)
  - ... because people find trial more  relevant (despite [lower]{.alert} control mean)

- Suggests experimenter demand does not drive belief effects
  - Experimenter demand likely implies low level for $\Delta_{self}$
  - Hard to see how it could generate [heterogeneous]{.alert} effects
