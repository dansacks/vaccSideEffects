## Disputed implications of falling vaccination rates

View 1: Right to refuse treatment outweights health consequences

- No mandate

View 2: Health consequences are large, positive, and rooted in science

- Mandate?

:::{.fragment}
Hypothesis: Communicating science of vaccines can [persuade]{.alert} people to vaccinate

- Information provision potentially welfare improving by correcting [internality]{.alert}

I am hoping to pursue this hypothesis in a series of experiments

- End goal: effective, scaleable information provision treatments 
- Today: First step of the causal chain

Strength of causal links are not clear, even for  moving beliefs 

- Vaccine hesitant people less likely to trust government or doctor
- May heavily weigh own or peer experience, or other information source

:::

::: {.fragment}

This paper: online experiment,  flu vaccine, short-run side effect info provision

- Study population: people not necessarily intending to take flu vaccine
- Powered for [beliefs]{.alert}, not actions (prespecified)
- Actual vaccination effects (hopefully) to come

:::



## Why the flu vaccine? Why side effects?

Why flu vaccine?

- Substantial health costs: 28,000 deaths, 35-40 million cases, 35-45% vaccination rate
- Many people, regular decision: feasible to study 

Why side effect information provision? 

- Side effect perceptions matter for choices
- Vaccine hesitant hold biased beliefs relative to clinical trials 
- Effectiveness and flu risk also natural targets, but beliefs here less biased


## Three research questions on scientific information provision and vaccine hesitancy

::: {.incremental}

1. Can side effect information from scientific studies shift beliefs about [personal risk]{.alert}?
2. Do responses vary with [source]{.alert} and [study population]{.alert}?
3. Does information shift vaccine [intention]{.alert} and [take-up]{.alert}?

:::


## Preliminary study results

Side effect information from scientific studies shifts [beliefs about personal risk]{.alert}

  - by 3 percentage points on a base of 15 (vs. 0-1 in clinical trials)

Belief responses don't clearly move with [source]{.alert}

  - Industry and academic arms similar have similar treatment effects; personal arm null
  - Inconsistent results for intervention emphasizing [study population]{.alert}

::: {.fragment}
Information shifts vaccine [intentions]{.alert}, noisy effect on actual vaccination
:::

:::{.fragment}
Results are highly heterogeneous [(not preregistered)]{.alert}

  - Belief responses bigger for people with worse priors, no previous flu vacc
  - Political views strongly predict belief responses and intention responses
::: 


## What's new here?
### Contributions to literature on vaccine hesitancy  + beliefs

Correlational evidence:
  
  - Mistrust in institutions, pessimistic beliefs (side effects and others).

Experiments find:

- Nudges + encouragement help but onlyto a limited extent 
- Identity of messenger can matter (racial concordance, political concordance)
- Messages correcting false beliefs mostly unhelpful. No work on short-run side effects.

[Contributions:]{.alert}

  - Message content matters: side effect infomation relevant. 
  - Mistrust in institutions matters because it impedes learning 


# Experiment Design

## Experiment overivew

[Screening wave]{.alert} Recruit 8,000 via prolific, screen for hesitancy, late November

- Don't intend to vaccinate against flu; may or may not vaccinate against flu
- Also measure vaccine info sources and experience with flu and COVID vaccines

[Main wave]{.alert} 3,500 vaccine hesitant participants, 1-7 days later

- Randomize information provision, measure priors, posteriors, vaccine intentions 
- Ask about trustworthiness and relevance of information, politics, demographics

[Follow-up wave]{.alert} 3,000 participants, 2-4 weeks later

- Obfuscate intentions then measure whether vaccinated this season
- Also measure recall of wave 2 (not discussed today)

## Information provision can  affect two dimensions of beliefs

1. Beliefs about what happened in the trial.
   
   - "SE (trial)" 

2. Beliefs about what would happen to you

   - Personal risk,$\tilde{\Delta}_{self,i}$ or sometimes "Delta"

We examine each separately 



## Incentivized elicitation of  beliefs about SE (trial) 

![](trial_info.png){width="100%"}

## Eliciting side effect beliefs 
### Conceptualization 

"Side effect" is causal effect of vaccine on short-run, severe adverse event rate

- Short-run: lasting a few days
- "Severe": grade 3, disruptive to your day - real cost, not just noticeable


Two requirements for us

1. Person specific: participant's expected effect, not population or trial average effect
2. Causal contrast, not level of symptom: $\tilde{\Delta}_{self,i} = \tilde{y}_i(1)-\tilde{y}_i(0)$


## Eliciting side effect beliefs 
### Operationalizaiton  

We get causal contrast by eliciting both potential outcomes. To elicit $\tilde{y}_{i}(0)$:

> For this question, please imagine, regardless of your actual vaccination status, that you **DO NOT** get the flu vaccine tomorrow or in the following few days.
>
> Thinking about yourself, how likely do you think you would be to experience a severe adverse event, such as headache, muscle ache, tiredness, joint pain, fever, chills, or general discomfort, in the following few days? 
>*(As a reminder, severe means bad enough to disrupty your daily activity)*

Elicit $\tilde{y}_i(1)$ analogously.  Subjective side effect rate $\tilde{\Delta}_{self,i} = \tilde{y}_{i}(1)-\tilde{y}_{i}(0)$.

:::{.fragment}
Before information provision, elicit [priors]{.alert} for $\tilde{y}_i(0)$ and $\tilde{y}_i(1)$ using [likert scale]{.alert}

## Heterogeneous effects consistent with belief updating rather than experimenter demand  {#hte-slide}
### Caution: not preregistered

Effects are larger for people with ...

- Diffuse priors: [no prior vaccine experience]{.alert} rather than mild experience
- Worse priors: Prior belief indicates [side effect likely]{.alert}
- Trust in institutions:  [says university info reliable]{.alert} 

Effects also larger for people who say they found industry info trustworthy and reliable

## Summarizing: Results are promising but puzzling

Promising: Some information does shift side effect beliefs and intentions

  - Insignificant take-up response reflects limited power, uncertainty (not precise null)

Puzzling: Inconsistent pattern of belief and intention responses

  - Industry arm reduces side effect beliefs but does not increase intentions
  - Personal arm does not change side effect beliefs but does increase intentions


##  Partial resolution: Political views {#het-polviews-slide}

## Politics matter  because they correlate with determinants of belief updating
### Caution: not pre-specified

View of trial

- Did you find it trustworthy? (0-10 scale)
- Did ou find relevant? (0-10 scale)

Views of university-provided information

- Do you obtain health care info from university research or researchers? 
- Do you consider it it reliable?

 [Appendix →](#appendix-toc-slide){.button}
 
## Expressive responding and experimenter demand are unlikely to explain these results {#expressive-slide}

People expressing their vaccine [preferences]{.alert}, or saying what they think we want to hear


Very difficult to explain pattern of treatment effects thusly

- Participants don't know which treatment arm they're in
- Control-vs-industry: same  signal of experiment intent, different $\tilde{\Delta}_{self}$
- Little priming: Political views after beliefs

More evidence: reported $\Delta_{self}$ inconsistent with expressive answering [Appendix →](#appendix-toc-slide){.button}

- Correlated with believed trial SE rate, own flu + covid vaccine experiencs 
- Correlations similar by political view


# Conclusions

## Conclusions and future work

An extremely uncreative, unslick presentation of scientific information made vaccine hesitant people update their [beliefs]{.alert} in a pro-vaccine direction 

When belief updating happens, scientific information shifts [intentions]{.alert}

- Political views key moderator of belief updating, via perceived study informativeness

Effect on [vaccinations]{.alert} statistically imprecise; noisy null

::: {.fragment}
Getting detectable effect on vaccinations likely requires bigger belief updating 

- Better presentation and communication of trials?
- Bigger information intervention (effectiveness + side effects)?
- Trusted, relevant source?
- Possibly other dimensions of information are more important?
