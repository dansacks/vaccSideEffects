## Disputed implications of falling vaccination rates

View 1: Right to refuse treatment outweights health consequences

- No mandate

View 2: Health consequences are large, positive, and rooted in science

- Mandate?

[Hypothesis: Communicating science of vaccines should [persuade]{.alert} people to vaccinate]{.fragment}

This paper: online experiment communicating clinical trial results for flu vacc

- Study population: people not necessarily intending to take flu vaccine
- Communication: potentially welfare improving [internality]{.alert} correction
- Helpful if beliefs are incorrect, relevant for choice, moveable

## An experiment on flu vaccine side effect info

Why flu vaccine side effects? 

- Low and falling flu vaccination rates, important for health
- Excess pessimism about side effects, side effects matter
- Unclear whether information from trials affects beliefs

Research questions:

::: {.incremental}

1. Can side effect information from scientific studies shift beliefs about [personal risk]{.alert}?
2. Do responses vary with [source]{.alert} and [study population]{.alert}?
3. Does information shift vaccine [intention]{.alert} and [take-up]{.alert}?

:::


## Preliminary study results 

Side effect information from scientific studies shifts [beliefs about personal risk]{.alert}

  - by 3 percentage points on a base of 15 (vs. 0-1 in clinical trials)

Belief responses don't clearly move with [source]{.alert}

  - Industry and academic arms similar have similar treatment effects; personal arm null
  - Inconsistent results for intervention emphasizing [study population]{.alert}

Information shifts vaccine [intentions]{.alert}, noisy effect on actual vaccination

:::{.fragment}
Results are highly heterogeneous by political views [(not preregistered)]{.alert}

  - Liberals' beliefs and vaccine intentions respond strongly, conservatives null/negative
  - Politics predict whether people find trials + university research trustworthy + relevant
::: 

## What is new here?
Literature on vaccine hesitancy and beliefs

- Vaccine hesitancy highly correlated with mistrust in institutions, pessimistic side effect beliefs. Messages correcting false beliefs (flu, pediatric) unhelpful but no work on side effect beliefs. Identity of messenger can matter (racial concordance, political concordance)
- [Contributions:]{.alert} Message content matters: side effect infomation relevant. Mistrust in institutions matters because it impedes learning 

Literature on information provision experiments 

- Simple information provisions shift beliefs and behaviors 
- [Contribution]{.alert}: Skeptical audience makes info provision challenging

# Experiment Design

## Experiment overivew

[Screening wave]{.alert} Recruit 8,000, screen for vaccine hesitancy, late November

- Don't intend to vaccinate against flu; may or may not vaccinate against flu
- Also measure vaccine info sources and experience with flu and COVID vaccines

[Main wave]{.alert} 3,500 vaccine hesitant participants, 1-7 days later

- Randomize information provision, measure priors, posteriors, vaccine intentions 
- Ask about trustworthiness and relevance of information, politics, demographics

[Follow-up wave]{.alert} 3,000 participants, 2-4 weeks later

- Obfuscate intentions then measure whether vaccinated this season
- Also measure recall of wave 2 (not discussed today)

## Eliciting side effect beliefs 
### Conceptualization 

"Side effect" is causal effect of vaccine on short-run, severe adverse event rate

- Short-run: lasting a few days 
- "Severe": grade 3, disruptive to your day - real cost, not just noticeable 


Two requirements for us

1. Person specific: participant's expected effect, not population or trial average effect
2. Causal contrast, not level of symptom: $\tilde{\Delta}_{self,i} = \tilde{y}_i(1)-\tilde{y}_i(0)$


## Eliciting side effect beliefs 
### Operationalizaiton  

We get causal contrast by eliciting both potential outcomes. To elicit $\tilde{y}_{i}(0)$:

> For this question, please imagine, regardless of your actual vaccination status, that you **DO NOT** get the flu vaccine tomorrow or in the following few days.
>
> Thinking about yourself, how likely do you think you would be to experience a severe adverse event, such as headache, muscle ache, tiredness, joint pain, fever, chills, or general discomfort, in the following few days? 
>*(As a reminder, severe means bad enough to disrupty your daily activity)*

Elicit $\tilde{y}_i(1)$ analogously.  Subjective side effect rate 
$\tilde{\Delta}_{self,i} = \tilde{y}_{i}(1)-\tilde{y}_{i}(0)$.

:::{.fragment}
Before information provision, elicit [priors]{.alert} for $\tilde{y}_i(0)$ and $\tilde{y}_i(1)$ using [likert scale]{.alert}

Outcomes

- $\tilde{\Delta}_{self}$ Side effect belief (primary)
- Side effect experienced in trial
- Intend to vaccinate
- Clicked on a link
- Indicated vaccination in follow-up survey

# Results

## Personal beliefs are likely biased but have high face validity

Mean believed side effect rates is +13 percentage points (median: +3)

- Trial estimates: -1.7 to +1

Highly correlated with prior vaccine experience, for flu and COVID vaccies 

Correlated with trust in doctors, willingness to follow gov vacc recommendations

Also correlated with politics (all biased, worse for moderate/conservative)

## Summarizing: Results are promising but puzzling

Promising: Some information does shift side effect beliefs and intentions

  - Insignificant take-up response reflects limited power, uncertainty (not precise null)

Puzzling: Inconsistent pattern of belief and intention responses

  - Industry arm reduces side effect beliefs but does not increase intentions
  - Personal arm does not change side effect beliefs but does increase intentions


##  Partial resolution: political views {#het-polviews-slide}

## Politics matter  because they correlate with determinants of belief updating
### Caution: not pre-specified

View of trial

- Did you find it trustworthy? (0-10 scale)
- Did ou find relevant? (0-10 scale)

Views of university-provided information

- Do you obtain health care info from university research or researchers? 
- Do you consider it it reliable?

 [Appendix →](#appendix-toc-slide){.button}
 
## Expressive responding and experimenter demand are unlikely to explain these results {#expressive-slide}

People expressing their vaccine [preferences]{.alert}, or saying what they think we want to hear


Very difficult to explain pattern of treatment effects thusly

- Participants don't know which treatment arm they're in
- Control-vs-industry: same  signal of experiment intent, different $\tilde{\Delta}_{self}$
- Little priming: Political views after beliefs

More evidence: reported $\Delta_{self}$ inconsistent with expressive answering [Appendix →](#appendix-toc-slide){.button}

- Correlated with believed trial SE rate, own flu + covid vaccine experiencs 
- Correlations similar by political view


# Conclusions

## Conclusions and future work

An extremely uncreative, unslick presentation of scientific information made vaccine hesitant people update their [beliefs]{.alert} in a pro-vaccine direction 

When belief updating happens, scientific information shifts [intentions]{.alert}

- Political views key moderator of belief updating, via perceived study informativeness

Effect on [vaccinations]{.alert} statistically imprecise; noisy null

::: {.fragment}
Getting detectable effect on vaccinations likely requires bigger belief updating 

- Better presentation and communication of trials?
- Bigger information intervention (effectiveness + side effects)?
- Trusted, relevant source?
- Possibly other dimensions of information are more important?
