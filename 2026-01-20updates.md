task 0:
- update claude.md to note that sometimes code will run on macos. Update _config.do to account for necessary changes (for example to the path). Determine whether make needs to be updated tobe able to run on both windows and mac, and if so, check in with me about possible update approaches.


Task 1: 

You have made a balance table using a subset of the pre-experiment variables. Now make an additional series of balance tables which collectively show balance across all pre-experiemnt variables. Specifically, review the control set in treatment_effects.do. Those control variables should all be included in the additional series of balance tables. 
- confirm the list of variables to include
- divide them up into domains (based on current grouping in code)
- make separate tables for each domain in the control set. each table should be analogous to the current balance table, with a final row for joint significance of the tables in the balance test.
- conduct a final omnibus balance test, tesitng joint significance across the domains.
- update make file. 

task 2:
Write a latex doc called "exhibits" that has an appropriate preamble, and when compiled incorporates in order all tables and figures produced. So far there are no figures and the tables are:
- count table`
- main balance table 
- subtables for balance
- treatment effect table
