## Research questions and hypotheses

1. Does information from clinical trials about side effects shift personal beliefs?
   [H1: As vaccine hesitant people's beliefs are generally more pessimistic than warranted by tials, this information will reduce expected side effects, especially for people with more biased beliefs]{.hyp}

2. Does information [source]{.alert} and [relevance]{.alert} matter?
   [H2.A: As vaccine hesitant people are often skeptical about institutions and pharmacy companies, beliefs will respond more to [academic]{.alert} than [industry]{.alert} trials]{.hyp}

   [H2.B: As vaccine hesitant people believe they experience worse-than-average side effects, beliefs will respond more to trials with [relevant population]{.alert} trials]{.hyp}

3. Does information shift vaccine intentions and behaviors?
   [H3: As side effects are relevant for vaccinations, info will increase vaccinations]{.hyp}
   
   [We are underpowerd for this outcome and pre-registered it as secondary]{.hyp}
