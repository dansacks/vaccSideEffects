set up:
1. vaccination rates are falling.
  - pediatric vaccinations
  - adult vaccinations: flu, covid 
  - public health officials, drawing on clinical trials and widespread scientific reserach, believe 
  substantial benefits that easily outweight costs. indeed this calculus is typically 
  central to the approval and recommendation process. 
    

2. traditional tool of mandate is increasingly limited
  - political pushback
  - potentially costly if vaccine hesitancy reflects real costs

3. An alternative approach is to persuade people that the benefits of vaccination are greater 
  of the costs lower than they previously believed. A natural way to do so is to share
  the scientific evidence that underlies vaccine recommendations. 

  if physicians and public health officials find this evidence persuasive, perhaps
  vaccine hesitant people will too. But sharing scientific info will shift vaccination 
  decisions only under three conditions

  Sharing each of which is potentially ambiguous.
  - Beliefs must be inconsistent with scientific evidence. 
  - choices sensitive to beliefs
  - Scientific information must be able to shift beliefs. Ambiguous whether this is true because 
    ossible skepticism about (a) idnustry-sponsored trials or (b) scientific enterprise in general, and 
    (c) relevance of  

4. This paper: examines whether scientific information affects beliefs about the flu vaccine,
  among the vaccine hesitant, focusing on information about short-run side effects. 
  This is a promising context because prior work has shown that beliefs about side effects 
  are inconsistent with scientific evidence and flu vaccine choices are sensitive to short-term 
  side effect rates. Thus the key question is whether scientific information can shift beliefs. 
  To test these ideas, we run an online experiment using 3500 vaccine hesitant participants. 

5. Our experiment has three treatment arms that aim to test the importance of particular sources
  of skeptiicism.  
    - industry arm
    - academic arm 
    - personal arm 

  
5.5 Our pre-specified main outcome metric is beliefs about side effect rates. [explain causal contrast]. Lots of validity. Predictors: clinical trial belief, but deviations predicted.
  predictors of this: (low) trust in government vaccine information, (low) willingness to follow doctor's
  advice on vaccines, (poor) prior experience with vaccines, flu and covid both (though flu is more important than covid.) indicates scope for correcting beliefs.

6. Main result: industry + academic arms both shift beliefs, roughly similar effects. Personal arm did not.
  Intentions also responded significantly to all three arms, but a follow up survey measuring (self-reported)
  vaccination decisions two weeks later did not find an effect. IMPLICATIONS FOR HYPOTHESES. 

7. several additional analyses suggest that these interventions successfully shifted beliefs and that beliefs
  are the channel through which they shifted intentions. heterogeneity. experimenter demand unlikely.

Argument: scientific information can influence beliefs and intentions of vaccine hesitant people.
