Title: Can scientific information address flu vaccine hesitancy? Evidence from an online experiment

Abstract:  In recent years pediatric and seasonal vaccination rates have fallen steadily, despite a strong scientific consensus that vaccinations are important for health. We investigate whether communicating scientific information about the flu vaccine can address vaccine hesitancy. We focus on side effect information because prior work has shown that beliefs about side effects are both influential for vaccine decisions and, for vaccine hesitant people, badly biased relative to clinical trials. We find that side effect information from scientific studies can shift beliefs about side effect risks and intentions to vaccinate among vaccine hesitant participants, despite their lower levels of trust in academic and government institutions.
