1. The final sample flag should limit the sample to the first response for a given pid, instead of dropping pids with multiple responses, for all data sets (prescreen, main, followup). update all do files to make this change.
2. count sample sizes should be updated to count the # obs that pass the following, in order: 
    - prescreen:
        - started prescreen (# non preview survey attempt)
        - consented
        - passed prescreen attention check
        - first attempt only
        - hesitant (vacc intent is "dont' intend" or "may or may not")
    -  main survey:
        - started (# non preview surveyattempt)
        - linked to the final set from prescreen (hesitant + pass all other checks)
        - consented
        - passed attention check in main
        - non-missing value of delta (and no -99 in posterior_vacc, posterior_novacc) 
        - first attempt only
    - follow up survey
        - staretd (# non preview attempt)
        - linked to the final set from main survey 
        - passed attention check in follow up 
        - has non-missing outcome (got_flu_vacc)
        - first attempt only
