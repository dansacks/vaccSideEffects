0. make a new directory called raw_data which contains the minimal raw data sets necessary for all replication. These are the spss files and the prolific-provided demographics files. Thre should be 3 spss files and 4 demographic files. Update the data cleaning pipeline to draw from these files. Also make a new directory called derived which contains all derived data sets. 
1. The final sample flag should limit the sample to the first response for a given pid, instead of dropping pids with multiple responses, for all data sets (prescreen, main, followup). update all do files to make this change.
2. count sample sizes should be updated to count the # obs that pass the following, in order: 
    - prescreen:
        - started prescreen (# non preview survey attempt)
        - consented
        - passed prescreen attention check
        - first attempt only
        - hesitant (vacc intent is "dont' intend" or "may or may not")
    -  main survey:
        - started (# non preview surveyattempt)
        - linked to the final set from prescreen (hesitant + pass all other checks)
        - consented
        - passed attention check in main
        - non-missing value of delta (and no -99 in posterior_vacc, posterior_novacc) 
        - first attempt only. this is the main survey sample. 
    - follow up survey
        - staretd (# non preview attempt)
        - linked to the final set from main survey 
        - passed attention check in follow up 
        - has non-missing outcome (got_flu_vacc)
        - first attempt only
3. make a balance table using the main survey sample. Each column is a treatment arm and each row is a different variable's mean. Add a final column for p-value for test of joint equality of each variable mean ,across the treatment arms. Also calculate and report the test for joint equality.  The variables are indicators for the following:
    -  prior_self_vacc somewhat likely or more likely (i.e. >=5)
    - "do not intend to vaccinate", from prescreen
    - previously had flu vacc
    - previously had covid vacc
    - severe flu vacc reaction (conditional on having had flu vacc)
    - sever covid vacc reaction (conditional on having coid vacc)
    - cond_none = 0 (conditional on not missing)
    - age 18-34
    - age 35-49 
    - race = white 
    - ethnicity = hispanic
    - inome < 50k
    - Somewhat or storngly trust govt (trust_govt >= 4)
    - somewhat or strongly follow doc (follow_doctor >= 4)
    - college degree (educ =4 or 5)
4. update make to reflect all these chnges
