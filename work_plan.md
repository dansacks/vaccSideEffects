## Vaccine info 
Goal: have a shareable draft by April 1; submit by June 30
Requirements:
- Analysis
 - Settle on inclusion criteria and linked demographics
    - table with flow of inclusoin criteria and sizes
 - Balance table / balance test
    - Table of summary stats [means/proportions], by treatment arm, with sample size at the bottom. Add column for p-value of equality across arms. Also report omnibus p-value.
    - Which pre-experiment variables?
        - prior beliefs (likert)
        - vacc intent, prior flu vacc, prior covid vacc; vacc reactions
        - demographics: [age, gender, educaiton, income, ethnicity, polviews]
        - trust in government
        - health conditions 
        - idea: table with a few key things, then series of detailed tables, with omnibus tests. Detailed tables are all the categories, by group. Table 1 should have maybe 13 rows
            - "belief XXX or higher", 
            - do not intend to vaccinate
            - prior flu vacc
            - prior covid vacc
            - had prior flu reaction
            - has a health condition 
            - age [binary], degree [binary], male, income level, white
            - something about trust levels [2]
 - Results on beliefs, intentions, behaviors
    - main table is already made
    - maybe a figure showing cdfs of beliefs by arm 
 - Heterogeneity: beliefs, trust
    - figure showing heterogeneity cuts by prior belief, trust in gov/docs, baseline vacc intent, baseline experience of side effects 
 - Descriptive work: correlates of beliefs, information sources 

- Writing:
 - introduction: motivaiton, related work, summary + contribution
    - build up to beliefs as an important, hard-to-move outcome
 - experiment design: sampling / recruitment / follow up; info provision. pre-analysis plan. 
 - descriptive results: info sources; belief correlates
 - interventional results: balance, main; heterogeneiety
 - discussion / limitations / issues
    - should we be worried that behavior didn't change?
 - conclusions  

 ## Vacc demand 
 - read older literature and determine differences
 - incorporate older papers into intro
 - update intro to write around (1) side effect info; (2) maybe something like Don's point about "mostly it seems rational"
 - in abstract and intro, be super clear that we provide incentives and follow up with real vaccine measures 
 - review reports for specific things to incorporate

 ## PCPs, EDs, Medicaid:
 Research question: does limited PCP access cause high rates of ED use?
 - descriptive: how many members have contact with PCP within time period, by type (kid, adult, chronic conditions); benchmark vs. WHIO
 - association between PCP use and ED use, conditional [patient type, conditions, county-year FE]
 - does PCP use vary across plan conditional on above set?
 - does plan seem to be randomly assigned? [how would you know? could we use CARES data]

 ## GLP-1 and work
 Research question: Does GLP-1 use, especially semaglutide, increase employment? 
 - design: probably the staggered adoption design we already used
 - fail fast test: how many semaglutide initiators by year
 - [note helpful to do this during the PHE disenrollment pause]
